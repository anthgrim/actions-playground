# Workflow Configuration

- The goal is for us to understand a workflow's effects and impact without running it

- Break down the .yml file to understand the workflow steps and actions used

- Correlate actions in the workflow with effects (build, test, deploy, etc)

**Example** A workflow with actions/checkout and actions/upload-artifact for building and storing results
